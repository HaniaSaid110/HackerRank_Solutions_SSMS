/*Note: the conditions in the case statement MUST be written in that specific order in either answers.

if you start with 'Isosceles', you will output the polygons that should be under the 'Not A Triangle' category as 'Isosceles', because there are other polygons which share the same property.
you have to make sure it's a triangle first, and then identify its type.
as for equilateral triangles, no other polygon shares the same property. so it can be put as the first condition as in the second answer.*/
